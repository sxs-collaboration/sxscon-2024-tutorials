    "# Preprocessing for FFTs\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we examine various steps that may be used to preprocess a waveform before applying a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).  The goal is to improve the quality of the FFT output, which may be used for further analysis or visualization.  While many techniques from signal processing are applicable, analyzing models of gravitational waves from merging binaries presents some unique challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * The signals \"chirp\" — increase in both amplitude and frequency — as they approach merger.\n",
    "  * The signals will also often contain memory — meaning that whereas they may oscillate around zero before merger, they settle down to some nonzero value after merger.\n",
    "  * For model waveforms there is essentially no noise, though numerical errors may be present.\n",
    "\n",
    "These factors lead us to make some unusual choices in processing our data.  We will examine the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. **Interpolation**: Sampling the data at a uniform time-step size.\n",
    "  2. **Tapering**: Applying a window function to the waveform before taking the FFT.\n",
    "  3. **Transition to constant**: Ensure that the ringdown approaches a constant value at late times.\n",
    "  4. **Padding**: Include more data into the waveform before taking the FFT.\n",
    "  5. **Line subtraction**: Remove a linear trend from the waveform.\n",
    "\n",
    "These steps are examined carefully — and specifically in view of the treatment of memory — in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06197).  This notebook is intended to provide a practical guide to implementing these steps with the `sxs` package.\n",

The current catalog, containing extrapolated data, does not include memory, so we will [add it](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01309) using the `add_memory` function.  We then interpolate this waveform to a uniform time-step size, which is necessary for the FFT.  For simplicity, we choose the time-step size as the smallest time step in the original data; more common choices might include interpolating to standard sampling rates after converting to physical units with some chosen total mass.  Finally, we will evaluate the waveform in a particular direction, as it would be observed in a detector."

    "## Window functions and tapering\n",
    "\n",
    "Windowing is an entirely standard technique in signal processing.  The primary goal is to limit the effects of the finite length of the data on the FFT.  The FFT assumes that the data is periodic, and so if the data is not periodic, the FFT will see a discontinuity at the edges of the data.  This discontinuity will lead to spectral leakage, where power from one frequency bin leaks into other frequency bins.  Notably, in standard signal processing, most windows are typically changing constantly; there is no region over which the window is constant.  For example, the standard \"Hann\" window is essentially $\\sin^2(\\pi t / T)$, where $T$ is the total length of the signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that merging binaries *chirp* is fairly unusual in signal processing.  We can think in terms of the [stationary-phase approximation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stationary_phase_approximation), and consider that (at least during the inspiral) each point *in time* corresponds fairly cleanly to a point *in frequency*.  Thus, if we want to accurately represent the signal over some sensitive frequency band, we should use a window that is *constant* over the corresponding region in time, rather than constantly changing like most window functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two standard choices of windows that are constant over a significant range are the cosine-taper or Tukey window, and the smooth compact tanh window (sometimes fallaciously called the \"Planck-taper\" window — despite having nothing to do with Planck, nor resembling his distribution).  Note that the cosine window actually has slightly *better* characteristics than the smooth window in practice, providing smaller spectral leakage except asymptotically, where the leakage is sure to be lost in noise and numerical error anyway.  Nonetheless, the gravitational-wave community seems to prefer the smooth window, so that is the default for the `sxs` package.\n",
    "\n",
    "Waveforms in the `sxs` package have a `window` method that will return a copy of the data windowed appropriately.  Here, we can see what the two windows look like.  Note that both are controlled by a set of parameters indicating when the window begins to increase from zero (`t1`), when it reaches 1 (`t2`), when it begins to decrease from 1 (`t3`), and when it reaches zero again (`t4`)."

    "\n",
    "While our standard idea of the ringdown of a black hole is a simple exponential decay to zero, the presence of memory means that the final value of the waveform is not zero.  Moreover, numerical errors can cause dynamical behavior that makes it difficult or impossible to provide a smooth transition back to the beginning of the periodic signal in preparation for the FFT.  In fact, we chose to load the waveform with `extrapolation_order=4` to emphasize this bad numerical behavior in the ringdown.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we don't want to taper the waveform to zero, but rather to some constant value, and to do so smoothly.  This can be done using the `transition_to_constant` method, which simply tapers the *derivative of the data* to zero.  The precise final value is not important, as long as the function is constant, so that we may match it to the beginning of the data in the next step.\n",

    "Again, the method has two parameters, denoting when to begin the transition and when to end it.
